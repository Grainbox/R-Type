# R-Type Game Project

## Overview
R-Type is an advanced C++ project focused on developing a multithreaded server and a graphical client for the legacy video game R-Type. This project is an exploration of networked game development, incorporating advanced software engineering techniques.

## Project Structure
- **Part 1:** Core game architecture and a working prototype.
- **Part 2:** Expansion of the prototype with specialized features.

## Key Features
- Networking with a multithreaded server and client.
- Architectural patterns of a real game engine.
- Implementation of a binary protocol for client-server communication.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Linux).

## Server
- Manages game logic.
- Acts as an authoritative source for game events.
- Robust and multithreaded design.

## Client
- Graphical display and input handling.
- Partial game logic execution.

## Tools and Practices
- CMake for build system management.
- Git for version control.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows.

## Documentation
- Emphasis on proper, continuous documentation throughout the project.
